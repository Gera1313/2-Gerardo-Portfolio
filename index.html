        <p class="about-me-content">
          On the 122nd day, May 8th, a Thursday, I must have had a restful
          night's sleep because I remained blissfully unaware during the entire
          journey, despite its bumpy nature. Awakening only upon our arrival, I
          found myself in a sprinkle of rain as I made my way to the train
          station. Fortunately, the station was open, providing refuge. However,
          the train to Rome displayed a 25-minute delay, a mere hiccup in my
          plans. As time passed, the delay extended to 30 minutes, then 35.
          Finally, the train arrived, and not wanting to disturb the slumbering
          passengers in their cabins, I opted to sit in the aisle.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-content">
          Upon reaching Rome, my immediate quest was to find a Wi-Fi connection.
          Alas, nearby locations proved fruitless, leading me to a local
          café/restaurant. There, I ordered a croissant and a banana juice,
          mainly for the privilege of using their Wi-Fi. Hostel hunting ensued,
          with a promising find near the Trastevere neighborhood priced at $55.
          The journey to inspect it proved fruitless, as the place was full and
          the host eccentric.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-content">
          Undeterred, I retraced my steps to the station and revisited the café
          for internet access. A new hostel was identified, booked, and I set
          off once more. The warm, sunny day accompanied me to the Bologna stop,
          though a wrong turn was quickly corrected. Arriving at the hostel, an
          unexpected delay awaited, with the lady at the front desk requesting
          patience until 2 pm. Finally settled, I ventured out, stopping by the
          supermarket for dinner supplies before returning to the hostel.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-content">
          A three-day metro pass secured, I traveled to the Colosseum. Exiting
          the metro, I was greeted by the awe-inspiring Roman ruin, its grandeur
          undiminished by ongoing restoration. Circumnavigating, I documented my
          journey and decided to enter, encountering a familiar Asian couple
          from Venice. They kindly captured a moment for me.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-content">
          Post-Colosseum, I meandered through the Forum entrance and a solitary
          road leading to a church. Navigating the main avenue, I reached the
          Monumento a Vitorio Emmanuel, marveling at ancient Roman ruins along
          the way. The monument's grandiosity was captured in photos, and after
          a daring street crossing, I proceeded to the Trevi Fountain.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-content">
          Passing the Italian parliament building, I reached the fountain just
          in time for sunset, savoring the ambiance. Despite the toll on my
          feet, I pressed on to the Spanish Steps, passing by the Spanish
          embassy. Climbing the stairs, I captured the moment before descending
          to the metro, retracing my steps to the hostel.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-content">
          En route, a pitstop at an ice cream store satisfied my craving. Back
          at the hostel, I indulged in bread and cheese in the communal area
          before retiring to my room with a coco yogurt. A chance encounter with
          a fellow traveler from Mexico added a pleasant twist to the day,
          concluding with a well-deserved rest.
